        To the left of this floating centered paragraph is the link to download Spotify, the music player I
        use. TO the right is the link to download phpStorm, the IDE I use for HTML and CSS editing. all 3 of
        these are floated left and centered with a div tag. Above, you'll see the Header, which is a different
         color. Doesn't it look pretty?
